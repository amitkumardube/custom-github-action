# Workflow to benchmark the default branch and store the results
# as an artifact.
name: Benchmark the default branch
# run this workflow only on new commits on the default branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "main" # replace with however your default branch is named

# A workflow consists of multiple jobs
jobs:
  benchmark:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Run the benchmarks
    # Which themselves consist of multiple steps
    steps:
        # Each step can have a name and either references another
        # github repository (as in this case) or a docker image (not shown).
        # Please note that all references must have a version tag,
        # which forces you to pin your versions (good!)
        # The first task just clones your repository into the
        # work area of the workflow
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

        # Normally you would produce the benchmark output here

        # In the last task we upload the benchmark results
        # as artifacts. This will allow us to use them in a different
        # workflow later.
      - name: Upload the results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        # this is how you pass arguments to the action,
        # in this case the arguments "name" and "path".
        # You can lookup what these arguments do
        # in the task repository:
